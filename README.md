Get started by going to www.rustup.rs , copy the link and run it from terminal in your home directory.

Follow instructions (stable version, press 1 and enter), then run source $HOME/.cargo/env

Type rustc --version and see you have a working version.

Run cargo new <name of your project> and you get a starter project for rust.

To compile and run the starter project, simply cd -> <name of your project> and type cargo run. This will compile and execute the code.
